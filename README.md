![alt text](https://github.com/uttusharma/meet_notify/blob/master/icons/icon-128x128.png?raw=true)

A chrome extension that will listen to given keywords in google meet, chat and sends a notification when a keyword is detected in the google meet chat.

I used to put the google meet tab on mute and at the end of each class, I used to miss roll call but with Meet Notify lose no more attendance.
